    "## Transformer Architecture\n",
    "Transformer Architecture Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\", is a deep learning model that relies entirely on the self-attention mechanism, which allows it to capture complex dependencies in sequential data. Unlike earlier RNN or LSTM models, Transformers do not process data sequentially but instead use parallel processing, making them highly efficient for tasks like language translation and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture consists of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encoder: Encodes the input sequence into a fixed-length context representation.\n",
    "    Decoder: Uses the context from the encoder to generate the output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component consists of multiple layers, primarily composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Multi-Head Self-Attention: Captures dependencies between tokens, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously.\n",
    "    Feed-Forward Neural Networks: Applies nonlinear transformations to the representations.\n",
    "    Residual Connections: Helps with gradient flow and enables deeper architectures.\n",
    "    Positional Encoding: Adds information about the order of tokens since the model does not inherently understand sequence order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images\\attention_research_1-727x1024.webp' width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT (Decoder-Only Architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) uses only the decoder part of the Transformer architecture. In GPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Causal Self-Attention: The attention mechanism is masked to ensure that each token only attends to previous tokens (unidirectional), preventing it from seeing future tokens during generation.\n",
    "    Autoregressive Generation: The model generates text one token at a time, predicting the next word based on previously generated words.\n",
    "    Pretraining and Fine-Tuning: GPT is typically pretrained on large datasets using a language modeling objective and fine-tuned on specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is well-suited for text generation tasks, such as chatbots and content creation.\n",
    "Encoder-Decoder Architecture (e.g., BERT + Seq2Seq Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder-decoder architecture, both components are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encoder: Processes the entire input sequence and generates a context-rich representation. This part is bidirectional, meaning it can attend to tokens before and after a given token.\n",
    "    Decoder: Uses the encoder's context representation to generate the output sequence. It uses two types of attention:\n",
    "        Self-Attention: Attends to previously generated tokens.\n",
    "        Encoder-Decoder Attention: Attends to the encoder's output to incorporate the input context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is typically used in sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, where an input sentence in one language is encoded, and the decoder generates the corresponding sentence in another language.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "    GPT: Decoder-only, autoregressive, unidirectional (used for text generation).\n",
    "    Encoder-Decoder (e.g., Seq2Seq models like BART, T5): Both encoder and decoder, bidirectional encoding, suitable for tasks requiring input-to-output transformations like translation and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction helps determine the use case: GPT excels in generating content, while the encoder-decoder architecture is better for tasks needing a transformation from input to output.\n",
